# Objective
This projected is intended primarily for learning. It will allow me to build a complete data pipeline, get exposure to AWS services (including S3 and SageMaker), and integrate the power of machine learning with a real, tangible application

# Description
With this project, I aim to use a camera to take photos of the area in front of a box fan at regular intervals, upload those photos to Amazon S3, manually label those photos as containing Tito (my dog who loves box fans) or not, train a model to recognize Tito, download that model to a controller, use a Raspberry Pi to control the fan, turning it on and off when Tito moves in front of and away from the fan.

# Tools used
* AWS Simple Storage Solution (S3)
* AWS SageMaker (Machine Learning)
* Raspberry Pi
